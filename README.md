# Multiplex_Ticket_Booking_System
<h3>It is the Backend API of our Project</h3>
This is a project build to facilitate Movie Ticket booking system

Online Multiplex Booking System is basically made of providing the customers an anytime and anywhere service for booking cinema tickets and providing information about the movies so as to schedule booking online. Using spring tool suite for backend services we propose to develop an application that can create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations on Halls, movies, and retrieve movie details based on  halls. In this application we intend to use Postgresql as our database, Java with spring tool for backend development. We intend to use tools like Postman, Swagger that are used in the industry for API testing and JUnit for testing the code. This system is basically aimed to provide complete information of the movie and schedule to the customer, according to which he can book the tickets.
